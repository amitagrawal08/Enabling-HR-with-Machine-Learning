# Enabling-HR-with-Machine-Learning


Problem Statement: -

A large company named XYZ, employees, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons –
•	The former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partner.
•	A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent.
•	More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize themselves to the company.

Goal of the Project: -
To model the probability of attrition using a Machine Learning models and to provide a desktop interface/GUI to check the prediction of attrition. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay i.e. to find out the significant variables impacting the employee attrition.
Coding Language Used: -	Python

Steps/Process followed: -
•	Domain and Business Understanding
•	Data Understanding
•	Data Preparation and Cleansing
•	Picked Significant features based on regression mechanism
•	Split the data into Training set and Testing set
•	Plot Confusion Matrix
•	Perform Predictions using different Machine Learning Algorithms
•	Picked the best Model based on highest Accuracy (86.7%)
•	Build desktop interface GUI using tkinter

Conclusion: -
The model analysis proves that company should focus on employees with following attributes to deal with attrition:
•	PercentSalaryHike
•	YearsInCurrentRole
•	MonthlyRate
•	HourlyRate
•	MaritalStatus
•	Gender
•	Age
•	DistanceFromHome
•	EnvironmentSatisfaction

tkinter Interface for HR also has been built.
